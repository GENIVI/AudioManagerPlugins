@page policyexample Example use-case and policy

   This section covers a typical use-case in a automotive system, and how to define a policy to 
realize the use-case. Consider a system with following sources USBPlayer, RadioTuner, 
trafficInfo and navigationGuide.
   As the names suggests the functionality of sources are as below
- RadioTuner : Used for listening to Radio.
- USBPlayer: Used for playing media stored on USB Mass Storage device.
- trafficInfo : used for playing traffic information 
- navigationGuide: This source is used for playing navigation guidance. 
    The connection request from the last two sources would not be triggered explicitly by the user. 

    A typical use cases would be as follows
 - user is listening to the radio, then USB device is connected, now automatically the playback of 
media inside USB should start, when the USB device is removed the RadioTuner should play 
automatically.
- RadioTuner is playing, there is a announcement from the trafficInfo or navigationGuide,
temporarily volume of RadioTuner should be brought down till the trafficInfo or 
navigationGuide is over. Once the trafficInfo or the navigation Guidance are over bring the volume
of the mediaPlayer or RadioTuner to original level.

    In order to achieve this use case let classify the RadioTuner and the USBPlayer as BASE
class and consider the remaining two source as INTERRUPT class.

    The policy for the above two use-case be written in psuedo code as below
\code
    - If there is a connection request
           - If request is of BASE, and  
           - If a BASE connection except the requesting source is connected then 
                - push active connection
                - connect requesting connection
           - If request is of INTERRUPT, and 
           - If BASE connection is in connected state then
                - limit BASE
                - connect interrupt
    - If there is a disconnection request
           - If request is of BASE, and  
                - disconnect requesting, and
                - POP If any connection present in the Queue
           - If request is of INTERRUPT, and 
                - disconnect requesting, and
                - unlimit BASE
\endcode

   This translates to the configuration as below
\code
    <policy trigger="USER_CONNECTION_REQUEST"/>
        <process>
            <condition>name(CLASS, REQUESTING) EQ "BASE"</condition>
            <condition>connectionState(CONNECTIONOFCLASS, REQUESTING, OTHERS) INC CS_CONNECTED</condition>
            <action type="ACTION_PUSH" className="N:BASE"/>
            <action type="ACTION_CONNECT" sourceName="REQUESTING" sinkName="REQUESTING"/>
        </process>
        <process>
            <condition>name(CLASS, REQUESTING) EQ "INTERRUPT"</condition>
            <condition>connectionState(CONNECTIONOFCLASS, REQUESTING, ALL) INC CS_CONNECTED</condition>
            <action type="ACTION_LIMIT" className="N:BASE" volume="-500"/>
            <action type="ACTION_CONNECT" sourceName="REQUESTING" sinkName="REQUESTING"/>
        </process>
    </policy>
    <policy trigger="USER_DISCONNECTION_REQUEST"/>
        <process>
            <condition>name(CLASS, REQUESTING) EQ "BASE"</condition>
            <action type="ACTION_DISCONNECT" className="REQUESTING" connectionState="CS_CONNECTED"/>
            <action type="ACTION_POP" className="N:BASE"/>
        </process>
        <process>
            <condition>name(CLASS, REQUESTING) EQ "INTERRUPT"</condition>
            <action type="ACTION_DISCONNECT" className="REQUESTING" connectionState="CS_CONNECTED"/>
            <action type="ACTION_UNLIMIT" className="N:BASE"/>
        </process>
    </policy>

\endcode
