\page systemProperties System Properties

Audio Manager allows defining the project specific system properties and the sound 
properties. In order to manage certain system specific behavior like debug log 
threshold level, allow unknown element registration etc., generic controller 
would reserve range system properties. This range of properties would be exclusively 
used by Generic Controller and no product should define system property in this range. 
This would allow reusing the existing command side interface to change the behavior of 
the system even at run time.

As shown in the diagram above the higher 4K range of the system properties is selected 
so as to remain backward compatible with existing products. The reserved system properties 
would be used to control behavior of system like
-	Debug log threshold level
-	Allow only routes present in topology
-	Allow unknown element registration etc.
The system properties can be configured in the controller configuration. Most system 
property would be treated as read only from the command interface; unless controller 
is started in special mode, letâ€™s call it debug/development mode.
In order to start the controller in debug mode, controller should be passed a command 
line switch. The TCLAP library would be used and the details of the switch are as below	
Switch name	D
<table>
<tr>
<td>Switch name</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Long switch name</td>
<td>Debug</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Start the controller in debug/development mode. In debug/development mode controller would supports additional features like read write system property etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Default value</td>
<td>False</td>
</tr>
</table>

The same logic would be extended for the source/sink/class properties to store the element 
specific information in the daemon database.

\section reservedProp Reserved System Properties

The reserved system property occupies the last 4K entries i.e. 61440 to 65535. 12 bit System property is made up of 5 bit use case ID and 7 bit system property.  In other words it can be calculated as 
61440 + 128*X + Y, where 
61440 is the reserved system property base,
X is the use case ID, and
Y is the system property offset.
The use case ID are defined as below
0 -> Global.<BR>
1 -> Registration/Un-registration use case.<BR>
2 -> Connect/Disconnect use case.<BR>
3 -> Set Volume use case.<BR>
4 -> Set Sound property use case.<BR>
5 -> Set system property use case.<BR>
6 -> Update use case.<BR>
7 -> Notification configuration use case.<BR>
8 -> Related to action execution.<BR>
9-31 -> reserved for future use.

<tr>
<td>SYP_GLOBAL_LOG_THRESHOLD</td>
<td>This is the threshold log level, only logs below this level would be sent to dlt</td>

<td>SYP_REGISTRATION_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_ELEMENT</td>
<td>If this property is non zero then the controller would permit the unknown elements. \ref elems </td>

<td>SYP_REGISTRATION_DOMAIN_TIMEOUT</td>
<td>This is the timeout value for which the controller would wait for all the domain registration to complete. If
within this timeout the domain registration is not complete then controller would send error trigger to the policy engine.</td>

<td>If this property is non zero then only routes mentioned in the topology are allowed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SYP_REGSTRATION_SOUND_PROP_RESTORED</td>
<td>If this property is set then it indicates that all sound properties are read from the persistence area
    and set to respective RA, later command side application can request this system property to AM to check 
    the status of sound properties restore.</td>
